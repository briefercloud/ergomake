These changes introduce pull-request previews.

After this change, [Ergomake](https://ergomake.dev) will create a preview environment whenever developers create a pull-request. Once the preview environment is up, Ergomake will post a link to access it.


# How it works

The ` + "`ergopack.yaml`" + ` file within ` + "`.ergomake`" + ` contains the configurations necessary to spin up an environment. Whenever this file exists in a pull-request, we'll use it to spin up a preview.

If the file we've suggested doesn't work, feel free to push more code to this branch (` + "`ergomake`" + `). Once it works fine, you should have a working preview link.

Here are the most common actions you may need to take:

1. Add environment variables by logging into [the dashboard](https://app.ergomake.dev) and selecting this repository.
2. [Adding a database to which your software connects](LINK TO DOCS PENDING).
3. [Add another repository upon which this application depends](LINK TO DOCS PENDING).


# Where to go from here

In our platform, you can configure branches to be permanently deployed. That way, you can access that branch at any time, regardless of whether there's a PR with its contents. **Permanent branches are useful for permanent staging, QA, or development environments.**
