These changes include a template for setting up pull request previews.

After you adjust this configuration file, [Ergomake](https://ergomake.dev) will create a preview environment whenever developers create a pull-request. Once the preview environment is up, Ergomake will post a link to access it.


# How it works

The ` + "`docker-compose.yaml`" + ` file within ` + "`.ergomake`" + ` contains the configurations necessary to spin up an environment. Whenever this file exists in a pull-request, we'll use it to spin up a preview.

Please update this ` + "`docker-compose.yaml`" + `file by pushing more code to this branch (` + "`ergomake`" + `). Once it works fine, you should have a working preview link.

Here are the most common actions you may need to take:

1. Create a ` + "`Dockerfile`" + ` to build your application and add it to ` + "`docker-compose.yaml`" + `.
2. Add any databases or other services your application depends on to ` + "`docker-compose.yaml`" + `.
3. Add environment variables by logging into [the dashboard](https://app.ergomake.dev) and selecting this repository.

For more information, please see our [documentation](https://docs.ergomake.dev/).


## Tips for writing your compose file

- You can see the build logs for your services in the [dashboard](https://app.ergomake.dev).
- Make the first service your front-end application. This will be the service whose link comes first in our comment.
- Expose your applications by binding their desired ports to ` + "`localhost`" + `. To expose port 3000, for example, you can use ` + "`3000:3000`" + `.
- Avoid unnecessary complications, like using ` + "`depends_on`," + "`volumes`" + `, and ` + "`networks`" + `.
- To seed your database, we recommend that you create a docker image with a seed. To learn how to do that, access Docker Hub and see the documentation there for the Mongo and Postgres images.


# Where to go from here

In our platform, you can configure branches to be permanently deployed. That way, you can access that branch at any time, regardless of whether there's a PR with its contents. **Permanent branches are useful for permanent staging, QA, or development environments.**
